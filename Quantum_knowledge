The basics of quantum computing and how quantum computers are different from the normal computers we  are using



Normal vs Quantum Computers

üñ• Normal Computers
	‚Ä¢	Use bits: each is either 0 or 1.
	‚Ä¢	Example: a light switch can only be OFF (0) or ON (1).
	‚Ä¢	If you run the same code with the same input, you always get the same output.

‚öõ Quantum Computers
	‚Ä¢	Use qubits: each can be 0, 1, or both at once (superposition).
	‚Ä¢	Real-life example: think of a spinning coin.
	‚Ä¢	When it‚Äôs spinning, it‚Äôs a mix of heads (0) and tails (1).
	‚Ä¢	When you catch it, it ‚Äúcollapses‚Äù to either heads or tails (like measurement in quantum).
	‚Ä¢	If you run the same quantum program many times, you may see different results. Together, these results show the probability distribution of all possibilities.

Main difference:
	‚Ä¢	Classical = deterministic, one definite answer.
	‚Ä¢	Quantum = probabilistic, many possibilities until measured.
